* There is now only one library, now called libperformance.

* libmonitor no longer automatically starts. Instead, set the environment
  variable PERF_GRAPH_FILENAME to where you want it to go.

* block_tracker now has an optional bool parameter to the constructor that
  will let you tell it whether to start or not
